# Budget Map

This project is a visualization of all-day spendings during travel. Data were based on a recent travel of one of the team-members in Lisbon, Portugal.
The main idea of the project is to visualize the places that have been visited during the travel showing their position at the map and the amount of money we spent there. The visualization contains:
 
 * **Slider:** Moves us throught the whole spendings of our trip. On top of it we can see the date and the time of each spending. 
 * **Bar chart:** It's mapped to the slider and shows the amount of spendings during the trip.
 * **Other interactions:** the user have the ability to hover over each place that they have visited and see some more details like if they paid by cash or by card and some memories of that place or activity. 

The project was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Libraries that we used were:

* [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) 
* [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
* [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/)
